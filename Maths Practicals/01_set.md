This block of code includes C++ Standard library headers.<br>
'<iostream>': This header is used for input and output operations. It defines the 'std::cin' and 'std::cout' objects.<br>
'<conio.h>': This header is specific to certain compliers. It provides functions for console input and output.<br>
'<vector>': This header provides the 'std::vector>' container class template, which is a synamic array that can resize itself automatically when elements are added or removed. vectors are useful for storing sequences of elements, similar
